                   <p>The word GREATNESS can be a natural ability to be better than all other.it can be 
                    a dream achieved. But in a real sense, it is an attitude of the heart that sincerely
                    desire to live for God and others. [matt.22:36-39]. THis is the greatest law to be
                    achieved, loving God and other and in the fulfillment of God's purpose over our lives,
                    His our own greatness.</p>

                    <p>Jacob's ladder is the DNA of God (Jesus Christ) let down to the earth so that it
                         could raise up to heaven that jacob might ascend that is communication with God.
                         Just as human DNA can transfer "Knowledge" and "Information" bidirectional. so do 
                         the Angels ascending and descending on jacob's ladder exchanging communication. </p>

                <img src="sam.jpg" alt="picture" width="95%" id="face" height="300px">
                <p>Not knowing the will of God in a certain matter, we may pray in faith that God will
                     do this for us if it be his will, abd he will do the things. But where God has 
                     revealed his will on any subject, by promising to do that thing we need not to
                     be ignorant of it or in doubt concerning it. if his word reveals healing to be
                     his will, just as surely as salvation is his will, if we fulfill the conditions.</p>
