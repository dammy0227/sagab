                   <p>The word GREATNESS can be a natural ability to be better than all other.it can be 
                    a dream achieved. But in a real sense, it is an attitude of the heart that sincerely
                    desire to live for God and others. [matt.22:36-39]. THis is the greatest law to be
                    achieved, loving God and other and in the fulfillment of God's purpose over our lives,
                    His our own greatness.</p>

                    <p>Jacob's ladder is the DNA of God (Jesus Christ) let down to the earth so that it
                         could raise up to heaven that jacob might ascend that is communication with God.
                         Just as human DNA can transfer "Knowledge" and "Information" bidirectional. so do 
                         the Angels ascending and descending on jacob's ladder exchanging communication. </p>

                <p>Not knowing the will of God in a certain matter, we may pray in faith that God will
                     do this for us if it be his will, abd he will do the things. But where God has 
                     revealed his will on any subject, by promising to do that thing we need not to
                     be ignorant of it or in doubt concerning it. if his word reveals healing to be
                     his will, just as surely as salvation is his will, if we fulfill the conditions.</p>

                <p>The scripture says we are judged of the Lord that we may not be condemned with the

                chastened of the Lord. Judgment is chastening. Hebrews 12:5-12. The essence of

             <p>God didn't just create man to work, earn degree, marry and die. Many don't know why they

                 Purpose and ambition are different. Ambition is your desire what you want but purpose is
                 not your desire (Heb.10:7). God can't write failure about you , the day you find yourself
                 in the book on what is written of you, you begin to walk in the path, your prosperity, 
                fame and infleunce is your purpose(Luke.4:17). Jesus discovered purpose the day He found

             <p>The time of the youth is the prime time in anyone's life. Unfortunitely, being young comes
                 only once in a life time. However, the time of the youth is the period of making choice 
                that makes indelible marks on one's life and destiny. There is a battle going on in this
                 world concerning young people and it's all about influencing their choices. About 50% of
                 the world population is youth and 40% of majority of them are outside God's programs. 
                Both God and devil are in search of the youth, because they still have their whole
                lifetime to serve them either. Image in the case of robbery, cultism, stealing,raping,

            <p>To know what is man (psalm 8) is to know God. The angels were asking what is man, not who
               is man. (psalm 8:4). it is the question of content not just personality. it is the question 
              that make up not just who he represnt and actually they don't know who a man is because 
              they haven't know what is in man. We can also see that they don't know who God is because 
              they don't know what is in God. The angels may know what God is doing as a mighty one. They 
              don't know man was fashioned from the dust of the ground but they don't know the potency of 
              what God want to installed in man so to the angels, man remain a mystery, but when they saw 
              the first man that unlocked what is called the content (treasure), they came and ministered 
              to him. He is the second man, the last Adam the man Christ Jesus. He is both God and man.

             <p>As a growing believer, there are things we need to leave behind consciously before our 
                 alignment can be possible with God. You must make a conscious decision to stop malice,
                 envies and the like before seeking the face or the help of God. Trans-dimensional
                 alignment cannot be possible if a conscious decision to put an end to a habit, sins and
                 fault has not be taken. There are some height that we cannot attain in the spirit if
                 malice, envies and the likes are still important to us. if the Bible instruct us to lay
                 them aside, that means we can carried them along as we grow. What determine our readiness 
                 to gain entrance in the spirit in our seriousness to lay aside weight. Because we cannot
                 enter with load and you cannot function with them. you must be light enough in your soul 
                 to penetrate in the spirit. They are stumbling blocks and veils.  </p>
