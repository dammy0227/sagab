                             it could raise up to heaven that jacob might ascend that is communication
                             with God. Just as human DNA can transfer "Knowledge" and "Information"

                             exchanging communication.
                            The ledder represnts a means of communication between God and man or
                            between the spirit and the physical. Jesus is the ladder because He is the 
                            branch between heaven and earth, the spirit and the physical. it is on that
                            ladder God descend to bring us up (ascend). just as DNA determines the

                              can be a dream achieved. But in a real sense, it is an attitude of the heart
                             that sincerely desire to live for God and others. [matt.22:36-39]. THis is 
                             the greatest law to be achieved, loving God and other and in the fulfillment

                            The scripture says we are judged of the Lord that we may not be condemned
                             with the world. so there is a condemnation that is coming on the world
                             but if we are being judges now, we won't be condemned with the world. When
                             we are judges, we are being chastened of the Lord. Judgment is chastening. 
                             HEBREW 12:5-12. The essence of chastening is to partake of the lord's
                            righteousness even though it is not sweet but will eventually produce 
                            righteousness in us. So the destination of this world is condemnation but
                            there is an assurance that if we are being judged now, we will not be condemned
                            when the world is condemned. Hebrews 1:1o-12. So there is a judgment and
                           perdition for ungodly men, where also this present Heavens and Earth is
                            reserved to be burnt. Ungodly man according to this scription are not those who 
                            are not going to church. Apostle Peter was talking to believers here. Ungodly 
                            men here are those who are not receiving judgment according to 1 CORINTIANS 11:32
                            , so we must be judged now that we may not be judged later as seen in 2 PETER 3:7 
                            JUDGMENT OF NOW IS CHASTENING, CORRECTION. JUDGMENT FOR NOW IS THE BEST SO IT IS 
                            EXPEDIENT WE PRAY FOR IT. 
                            <br>
                            Something, we may think we cannot get angry again or think we are so humble now 
                            until we find ourselves in a particular situation or circumstance and you wonder you 
                            can still get angry, and see that there is still pride within. Oftentimes we do not 
                            even know how thick the darkness on our inside is until the word of God reveal them. 
                            IT IS BY THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE WORD OF GOD THAT THESE THINGS ARE PURGED.
                            <br>
                            Out of our heart flows issues that pertain to our life (if the life of sin and death 
                            is what sit in the heart, then what expresses itself is life of sin and death).
                            <br>
                            so the word of God must purge our hearts that righteousness may be the life that sit 
                            there, and that we may express righteousness as our life. it is amazing that 
                            without revelational knowledge by the word of God, one can be going to church for 
                            30years or more, fervent and yet nature of sin and death is intact.

                         The demand to raise a prayer tower comes when the need to spiritually contend
                         with other tower that are influencing a particular territory against the will of
                         God arises. A tower is raised when people beagn to call upon the name of God on
                         a particular matter. A tower must be strong and infleunce in the spirit before 
                         it can contend. <br>
                         Every territory has a tower raised by their participate to make
                         sure they are in charge of everything. Those local alters and idols are the
                         strong tower of such territory.
                         <br> They are the prime influence of the territory,
                         they control everything including the largest percentage of the religion system.<br>
                         The purpose of God might not be establish in a territory except a prayer tower
                         is erected to combat with other tower of negative influence.<br> An alter is a prayer
                         tower. Ministry can find expression from a constructed tower. If you are going to
                         do anything meaningful in any place, raise a tower first, strong enough to
                         contend with the forces therein.<br>
                         Don't become a cheap pry for satan by your prayerless life. start calling upon the 
                         name of the LORD and start seeking His face now.

                           everyone has his/her purpose. Purpose and ambition are different. Ambition 
                          is your desire what you want but purpose is not your desire (Heb.10:7).<br>
                           God can't write failure about you , the day you find yourself in the book
                          on what is written of you, you begin to walk in the path, your prosperity,
                           fame and infleunce is your purpose(Luke.4:17).<br> Jesus discovered purpose the

                          is before (Gen 2:18).<br> Do you know that God expext you and i to live Gen 2:15
                          which is 'Purpose' before he gives you Gen. 2:18 which is 'Relationship'
                         (man/woman).<br> Stop running to know people when you don't know 'PURPOSE' because
                          you will struggle to keep people that are not relevant to your life when you've
                         not discovered why you are here on earth.<br> God had plan to give Eve Adam, but
                         before he gave her to him, he gave Adam 'PURPOSE'. 'If you dont know who you

                             being young comes only once in a life time. However, the time of the youth
                             is the period of making choice that makes indelible marks on one's life and 
                             destiny. There is a battle going on in this world concerning young people 
                            and it's all about influencing their choices. About 50% of the world
                             population is youth and 40% of majority of them are outside God's programs.
                             Both God and devil are in search of the youth, because they still have their
                             whole lifetime to serve them either. Image in the case of robbery, cultism,

                             involved.<br>
                             In the bible time, God used youth that make themselves available
                             fo Him, such as; Joshua, Joseph, Samuel, David, Mary, Timothy, etc. Whenever
                             he get hold of someone, age is not barrier to God. But the case is different
                             in today world! <br>
                             The youth have incordinate desire to taste the world, they
                             are easily carried away at any slight appreciation.They have passion for 
                             immoralities- it is a demonic spirit strongly controlled by lust through 
                             deception and suggestion. it promotes dirty thought, kill God's grace on its 
                             victim, and destroy his prayer life (ROM 12:1-2; ROM 8:12-14).<br>

                            To know what is man (psalm 8) is to know God. The angels were asking what
                            is man, not who is man. (psalm 8:4). it is the question of content not just 
                            personality. it is the question that make up not just who he represnt and
                            actually they don't know who a man is because they haven't know what is in
                            man. We can also see that they don't know who God is because they don't know
                            what is in God. The angels may know what God is doing as a mighty one. They
                            don't know man was fashioned from the dust of the ground but they don't know 
                            the potency of what God want to installed in man so to the angels, man remain
                            a mystery, but when they saw the first man that unlocked what is called the 
                            content (treasure), they came and ministered to him. He is the second man, 
                            the last Adam the man Christ Jesus. He is both God and man.
                            <br> Everything on earth either in relation to God or to man depend on this
                            treasure. God's by wisdom crafted it like that, for the treasure to be placed
                            inside the earthen vessel is wisdom. it is through this technology that God 
                            will make His manifold wisdom to be demonstrated to the principalities and power
                            (Ephesians 3:20). it is through this technology that God will used man to 
                            silence the mouth of the enemy and the avenger (psalm 8:2).<br> Christainity does
                            not eliminate weakness, nor does not only look to the lord power, Christianity
                            means that the Lord's power is made manifest in man's weekness. Bro, man's
                            weakness can manifest God's power. The suffering for Christ is to make that
                            pearls find more expression. The more you pressed, the more the fragrance 
                            from the alabaster box find expression.<br> When you look at people don;t focus
                            on the earthen vessels, if not, you may loosed them and not gained them to
                            God. it will be a great blessing to focus on the life of Christ inside of them.
                            We must also know that our human, earthen vessels is joined to God's 
                            treasure. it was crafted by wisdom. for we know man after the flesh but by 
                            after the spirit.
